    <h1>Photography</h1>
    <i>Capturing moments. Telling stories. Seeing the world differently.</i>

        <h2>Why Photography?</h2>

        <p>Photography is more than clicking pictures — it’s about noticing details that often go unseen. A
            ray of
            sunlight, a smile, a shadow, or a quiet street can become meaningful through a photograph.

            Photography allows you to freeze moments in time and tell stories without using words. Whether
            you use a
            smartphone or a camera, photography is a hobby that anyone can start, anytime, anywhere.</p>

        <p>Photography also helps you slow down and be more present in the moment. When you look through a
            lens, you begin to observe light, colors, and emotions more carefully. Over time, photography
            becomes not just a hobby, but a way of seeing the world with curiosity and appreciation, turning
            ordinary moments into lasting memories.</p>

                    <p><b>Poojitha Kumar – Photography</b><br>

                        Photography became a part of Poojitha’s life when she started noticing small moments around her
                        —
                        flowers on
                        her morning walks, changing skies, and candid smiles of people around her.

                        She didn’t start with professional equipment. She started with curiosity.
                        <br><br>
                        “Photography taught me to see beauty in the simplest things.”

                        Photography makes her feel excited and mindful. Every photo feels like a small discovery, and
                        every mistake
                        becomes a lesson.

        <h3>How Poojitha Started Her Photography Journey</h3>
        <p>
            Poojitha began her photography journey using just her mobile phone. She clicked pictures during her daily
            routine — while walking, traveling, or spending time with friends.
        </p>

        <p>She learned by experimenting:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Trying different angles</li>

            <li>Observing how light changes a photo</li>

            <li>Clicking the same subject in different ways</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Instead of focusing on perfection, she focused on enjoying the process and learning something new every day.
